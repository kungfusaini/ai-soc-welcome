# KCL AI Society Welcome Demo

This is a demo set up for the welcome fair at kings. Students can input their email which will be added to out mailling list. Then, they will be asked to input a sentence, which will then generate a piece of AI art using stable diffusion via hugging face. The images should then be displayed on the page so they can be browsed.
