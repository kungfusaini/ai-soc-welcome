# KCL AI Society Welcome Demo

This is a demo set up for the welcome fair at kings. Students can input their email which will be added to out mailling list. Then, they will be asked to input a sentence, which will then generate a piece of AI art using stable diffusion via hugging face. This image will then be sent to them via email. The images should then be displayed on the page so they can be browsed.
